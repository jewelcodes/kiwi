# Kiwi

Kiwi is a prototype high-performance general-purpose Unix-like operating system. It is still very early in its development and so for the time being, there is probably not a lot to see here.

Kiwi is intended to be a complete redesign and rewrite of [luxOS](https://github.com/lux-operating-system) and is planned to use entirely custom-written core components (i.e., a custom boot loader, a custom kernel, a custom libc, etc.) Updates will be posted here as more progress is made.
